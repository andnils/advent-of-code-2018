# Advent of Code 2018

Code for [advent of code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).


Special note: day 9 uses a custom Java class to implement a mutable circular list. It needs to be compiled.

Day 11 also uses a special Java class for performance reasons.

Just run:

```
$ make
```

...to compile the java classes.
